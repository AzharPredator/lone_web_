    <p>5.5 You confirm that you will only use our Blend Platform for the purposes set out in these terms and conditions.</p>
    <p>5.6 You will not attempt to gain unauthorised access to restricted areas of the Website or Blend Platform and you will not attempt to use code or software to manipulate or automate functions available on our Website.</p>
    <p>5.7 You understand that we may store your IP address information and may monitor your use of the Website in accordance with our cookie policy (as updated from time to time).</p>
    <p>5.8 The Blend Platform opening hours are decided by us and may be varied without notice.</p>

    <p>5.9.1 in our reasonable opinion we deem that your instruction was not sufficiently clear to act upon;</p>
    <p>5.9.2 we could not verify your identity to our reasonable satisfaction;</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">6. Risk Warning</h2>
    <p><strong>Loss of Capital</strong></p>
    <p>6.1 Lending to businesses can lead to a loss of your capital and there is a risk that the companies or individuals you lend to may default. You should not lend more money than you can afford to lose. If you are unsure about any aspect of the information provided, you should seek advice from an independent financial adviser.</p>
    <p>6.2 It is your responsibility to assess whether the Blend Platform is suitable or appropriate for your needs and any decision made to use our Lending Services is done so entirely at your own risk.</p>
    <p>6.3 Whilst secured loans are secured against assets of the Borrower and or third parties, the enforcement of Security can result in delays in receiving any recovery of your Loan. In addition the proceeds of sale derived from such assets may not be sufficient to cover in full the principal amount of your secured Loan nor the payment of interest nor any other amounts which may be due to you.</p>
    <p>6.4 If a Loan Auction is partially underwritten by a third party this does not in any way infer any warranty as to the credit worthiness of a Borrower or the suitability or security being provided for such Loan.</p>
    <p><strong>Illiquidity</strong></p>
    <p>6.5 A Lender Member’s Loan Participation will not be accessible until the Loan expires and is repaid unless the Lender Member is able to sell their Loan Participation on the Secondary Market (see clause 16 below). There is no guarantee that there will be a buyer for a Loan Participation listed for sale on the Secondary Market.</p>
    <p><strong>Diversification</strong></p>
    <p>6.6 Lending to businesses should be done as part of a diversified portfolio. This means that you should invest small amounts in multiple asset classes as opposed to a large amount in one or a few. You should also invest only a small proportion of your investable capital in this asset class, with the majority of your investable capital invested in safer, more liquid assets. You are able to further diversify by lending to multiple businesses on the BLNL Platform as opposed to just one.</p>
    <p>6.7 You should consider whether our Lending Services meet your acceptable risk levels and investment objectives and you should only commit such funds for which you are able to financially bear the risk of loss considering all other financial commitments.</p>
    <p><strong>Tax</strong></p>
    <p>6.8 You are responsible for the administering of your own tax affairs, which may include capital gains and/or income tax. Each time you lend, you must satisfy yourself prior to making any commitment that you understand and accept the tax consequences to you. We do not provide tax advice and you should seek this independently before lending if you are unsure of your position. It is your responsibility to ensure that your tax return is correct and is filed by the deadline and any tax owing is paid on time. If you are unsure how this investment will affect your tax status you must seek professional advice before you lend.</p>
    <p>6.9 Tax treatment is dependent on the individual circumstances of each Lender Member and may be subject to change in the future.</p>
    <p><strong>Financial Services Compensation Scheme</strong></p>
    <p>6.10 Lending through BLNL Platform is not covered or otherwise insured by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Your capital may therefore be at risk if a Borrower fails to repay a Loan that you have participated in.</p>
    <p><strong>Advice</strong></p>
    <p>6.11 BLNL does not give investment advice or provide analysis or recommendations regarding investment opportunities to our Lender Member. Investments can only be made by Lender Members on the basis of information provided. BLNL takes no responsibility for this information or for any recommendations, opinions or predictions.</p>
    <p><strong>Past Performance</strong></p>
    <p>6.12 Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. You should not rely on any past performance as a guarantee of future investment performance.</p>
    <p><strong>Future performance</strong></p>
    <p>6.13 Borrowers may provide forward-looking statements with respect to future results. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and many different factors could cause actual results to be different from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. As such, forecasts are not a reliable indicator of future performance.</p>
    <p><strong>Lack of Operating History</strong></p>
    <p>6.14 Many Borrowers on BLNL are recently formed entities and have no substantive operating history upon which prospective investors can evaluate likely performance.</p>
    <p><strong>Lender Member Classification</strong></p>
    <p>6.15 Before being allowed to lend, you will need to be classified as an investor type. You will need to provide the relevant information to us, which you warrant to be truthful and accurate, in order that we can classify you. Please follow the steps when signing up to complete this process. If you no longer fall into at least one of the categories of investor available, you will give immediate written notice to BLNL and you will not access, or try to access the service unless and until you fall into one or more of these categories again.</p>
    <p>6.16 Please be aware that acceptance as a Lender Member of the Blend Platform does not imply that we have confirmed that our Lending Services are suitable or appropriate for you.</p>
    <p><strong>Jurisdiction</strong></p>
    <p>6.17 The information and services provided on the BLNL Platform are not provided to, and may not be used by, any person or entity in any jurisdiction where the provision or use thereof would be contrary to applicable laws, rules or regulations of any governmental authority or where BLNL is not authorised to provide such information or services. Some products and services described in the Site may not be available in all jurisdictions or to all clients.</p>
    <p>6.18 This list of risk factors does not purport to be a complete enumeration or explanation of the risks involved. Prospective lenders should read the relevant Borrowers’ pitch documents in their entirety and consult with their own advisers before deciding whether to lend. If you are unsure about any aspect of the information provided by the Borrower, you should seek advice from an independent financial adviser.</p>
    <p><strong>Lender Member’s Acknowledgments</strong></p>
    <p>6.19 In becoming a Lender Member you acknowledge:</p>
    <p>6.19.1 that you have read carefully and understood these Risk Warnings and have contemplated the risks involved and acknowledge that any Loan you participate in is entirely at your own risk;</p>
    <p>6.19.2 that there is no guarantee the money you invest in participating in a Loan will be repaid;</p>
    <p>6.19.3 that your capital is at risk;</p>
    <p>6.19.4 that your investment is not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and if a borrower to which you have lent monies by participating in a loan fails to repay any capital or interest on such loan you may accordingly lose some or all of your money invested in such Loan;</p>
    <p>6.19.5 in the event that a Borrower defaults on a Loan in which you have a participation BLNL, the Blend Platform, the Security Trustee and the Sponsor shall not have any liability to you whatsoever for any such loss;</p>
    <p>6.19.6 you are bidding and lending entirely at your own risk and accept and acknowledge that none of the Blend Platform, BLNL nor the Security Trustee nor the Sponsor provide any investment or other advice or recommendation whatsoever;</p>
    <p>6.19.7 none of the Blend Platform, BLNL nor the Security Trustee nor the Sponsor is providing any representation or warranty whatsoever including for the avoidance of doubt any warranty or representation relating to:</p>
    <p>(i) the ability of a Borrower to repay a Loan or to comply with its obligations under the Loan Documents</p>
    <p>(ii) the adequacy of the value of any Security provided for a Loan.</p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">7. Loan Auction Particulars</h2>
    <p>7.1 The Loan Auction Particulars for each Loan are prepared by the Sponsor or the Platform with the assistance of the relevant Borrower and is based on information provided by the relevant Borrower.</p>
    <p>7.2 Whilst BLNL takes reasonable care to review each of the Loan Auction Particulars prior to their publication on the Blend Platform, BLNL cannot assure Lender Member of the accuracy and completeness and non misleading nature of the information provided therein and relies on the information provided to it by the Borrower and Sponsor regarding the details contained in the Loan Auction Particulars.</p>
    <p>7.3 To the extent fully permitted by the law, none of the Blend Platform, BLNL, the Security Trustee or the Sponsor accepts any responsibility whatsoever for any liability arising as a result of any information contained within or omitted from the Loan Auction Particulars.</p>
    <p>7.4 Lender Members should undertake their own investigations and analysis of the lending opportunity set out in the Loan Auction Particulars to decide on whether such an investment is suitable for them.</p>
    <p>7.5 BLNL and the Blend Platform are not responsible for any information posted on the Blend Platform by Borrowers and/or Member Lenders in relation to a particular Loan Auction. The Blend Platform has absolute discretion as to whether or not it wishes to delete or clarify any such information posted.</p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">8. Lender Members Account</h2>
    <p>8.1 To enable a Lender Member to Bid on a Loan a Lender Member will need to ensure that it has transferred sufficient funds to its Lender Member’s Account so that the Lender Member’s Account has sufficient cleared funds to cover the amount of the Bid the Lender Member wishes to make for a Loan Auction. All funds transferred to the Lender Member’s Account must be sent from a bank account which is in the Lender Member’s name. When such funds have cleared the Lender Member will be able to view the balance available in its Lender Member’s Account on the Blend Platform.</p>
    <p>8.2 The funds transferred by a Lender Member to their Lender Member’s Account will be held in a e-wallet with MangoPay until (i) these funds are applied towards a Loan drawn down by a Borrower on which a Lender Member has successfully Bid, or (ii) returned to a Lender Member if requested by a Lender Member (subject always to such monies not being blocked as a result of funds being allocated to a Bid made by a Lender Member for a Loan Auction - see paragraph 8.13 below for further details of blocked funds).</p>
    <p>8.3 The Lender Member’s Account is operated by MangoPay which is an independent company which has been engaged by BLNL to provide account management and administration services. Funds held by MangoPay are held in accordance with CCSF’s rules and regulations and will be kept separate from any monies belonging to BLNL. In the event of MangoPay’s insolvency BLNL will not be responsible or liable for any shortfall in recovering a Lender Member’s monies from the Lender Member’s Account.</p>
    <p>8.4 Lender Members may electronically withdraw all or part of their uncommitted funds from their Lender Member’s Account at any time by making such a request through the Blend Platform. On receipt of such a request we will instruct MangoPay to transfer the requested funds to the Lender Member’s Designated Bank Account. Requests for the return of funds can only be accepted using the secure Website. Funds will only be returned to a Lender Member’s Designated Bank Account registered on the Lender Member’s Account. Transfers will be processed as soon as reasonably practicable but may take several days to process.</p>
    <p>8.5 Any banking charges incurred by a Lender Member with their bank for the transfer of funds from their Designated Bank Account to their Lender Member Account will be at the cost of the Lender Member.</p>
    <p>8.6 On receipt of a Borrower’s payment of capital and or interest on a Loan such monies shall be allocated to the corresponding Lender Member’s Account in accordance with their Loan Participation within 2-3 Business Days, save as provided for in clause 8.7 below in the event of a partial payment received from the Borrower.</p>
    <p>8.7 In the event of an under payment by a Borrower of either Interest or capital such sums shall be paid to the Lender Members pro rata to their Loan Participation. In such circumstances BLNL will use all reasonable endeavours to credit such payments into the Lender Member’s Account as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
    <p>8.8 No interest will be payable to Member Lenders on funds held in the Lender Member’s Account.</p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">9. Loan Auctions / Bidding</h2>
    <p><strong>Types of Loan Auctions</strong><br></p>
    <p>9.1 Loans available on the Blend Platform are all with fixed interest rate.</p>
    <p>9.2 The fixed interest rate is stated in the Loan Auction Particulars and Lender Members Bid at this rate. Bids are accepted until the Loan Auction is filled on a first come first served basis. Any Bids made once the Loan has filled are disregarded.</p>
    <p>9.3 The Blend Platform also provides an optional “Auto Lending” facility where a Lender Member can pre-set their lending criteria and Auto Lending will lend on a new Loan in the amount the Member Lender has specified subject to the new Loan satisfying the Lender Member’s pre-set lending criteria.</p>
    <p>9.4 Auto Lending is based on a first come first served basis. If a Loan Auction is oversubscribed priority will be given to those Lender Members who first switched on their Auto Lending facility for the Loan Auction in question.</p>
    <p><strong>Other loan auctions</strong></p>
    <p>9.5 The Blend Platform reserves the right to introduce additional formats for Loan Auctions. If so, details of any such format shall be set out in the relevant Loan Auction Particulars.</p>
    <p><strong>Bidding Bonus Programme</strong></p>
    <p>9.6 Lender Members who meet the criterion set out in clause 9.7 below will be invited to join our “Bidding Bonus Programme” subject to the terms set out in these clauses 9.6 to 9.9.</p>
    <p>9.7 The criterion referred to in clause 9.6 is that, subject always to clause 9.9, the Lender Member proposes to invest not less than £100,000 in relation to a relevant loan (“Minimum Bid”), and who can prove to BLNL’s sole satisfaction that they have sufficient liquid assets to make such an investment on short notice.</p>
    <p>9.8 Lender Members who join the Bidding Bonus Programme will:</p>
    <p>9.8.1 be provided with information relating to a Lending Opportunity in advance of other Lending Members who are not part of the Bidding Bonus Program on the Blend Platform; and</p>
    <p>9.8.2 should the Lender Member make a Loan equal to or greater than the amount of the Minimum Bid, the Lender Member shall receive from us an amount equivalent to between 0% and 2% (inclusive) of the amount of the Loan made by that Lender Member, such percentage to be determined at BLNL’s absolute discretion but which shall be communicated to the relevant Lender Member prior to their decision to invest in a Loan. Any such reward shall be credited to the Lender Member’s Lender Member Account following drawdown of the relevant loan.</p>
    <p>9.9 Should any Lender Member join the Bidding Bonus Programme but fail to make a Bid of at least the amount of the Minimum Bid in relation to three [consecutive] Loan Auctions, such Lender Member shall no longer automatically be eligible to be part of the Bidding Bonus Programme and may be removed from the Bidding Bonus Programme at BLNL’s absolute discretion.</p>
    <p><strong>Bidding process</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Binding nature of Bids</strong></p>
    <p>9.10 As a Lender Member, you agree that once you place a Bid, you may not withdraw your Bid unless:</p>
    <p>9.10.1 the Loan Auction period expires and the Loan is not funded to the Minimum Loan Requirement Amount; or</p>
    <p>9.10.2 the Borrower declines an aggregated Loan offer from you and other Member Lenders on the Blend Platform; or</p>
    <p>9.10.3 we withdraw an auction for a Loan or a Loan offer made to a Borrower; or</p>
    <p>9.10.4 there is a significant material change to the terms of the Loan that may cause you to re-evaluate your bidding on the Loan.</p>
    <p>9.11 BLNL reserved the right and shall have the absolute unfettered discretion to withdraw a Lender Member’s Bid from a Loan Auction.</p>
    <p>9.12 It is a condition of a Loan being made (and advanced by the Blend Platform) that it is funded to the Minimum Loan Requirement Amount. A completed Loan will be funded by those Member Lenders who together have placed Bids which in aggregate are equal to the total loan requested as part of the Loan Auction or the Minimum Loan Requirement Amount.</p>
    <p><strong>Sufficient funds available in Lender Member’s Account</strong></p>
    <p>9.13 Each Lender Member, before making any Bid, must have sufficient cleared funds in their Lender Member Account. Lender Members will not receive any payment of bank interest on the balance held in their Lender Member Account from time to time.</p>
    <p>9.14 When you make a Bid, you will specify the amount you wish to make available to a Borrower in respect of a specific Loan Auction.</p>
    <p>9.15 Subject to having sufficient cleared funds in your Lender Member Account there is no limit to the number of Bids you can make for the same Loan Auction. For each such Bid you will need to specify the amount you wish to make available to a Borrower.</p>
    <p>9.16 You acknowledge and confirm that when you participate in Loans through the Blend Platform you are lending to a Borrower via business lending and are not lending money to BLNL nor the Security Trustee.</p>
    <p>9.17 Once you have made a Bid, a sum equal to the Bid you have made will be blocked from your Lender Member’s Account and will not be able to be utilised for any other Bid unless drawdown of the Loan does not take place.</p>
    <p>9.18 Bids for a Loan Auction will constitute an irrevocable offer by the Lender Member to provide a Loan for such amount Bid to a Borrower in respect of the Borrower’s Loan Auction. Bids cannot be withdrawn and a Borrower may accept the same subject to the Borrower’s Minimum Loan Requirement Amount having been raised by the Loan Auction. Once your Bid has been accepted by a Borrower you are bound to make the Loan available to the Borrower.</p>
    <p>9.19 BLNL has the discretion to close a Loan Auction early in the event that sufficient Bids have been made which in aggregate reach the Borrower’s Minimum Loan Requirement Amount.</p>
    <p>9.20 Where sufficient Bids have been made for a Loan Auction the funds blocked from the Lender Member’s Account when the Lender Member made their Bid will, subject to drawdown of the Loan taking place, be utilised in making the Loan advance to the Borrower. BLNL will arrange for the monies being drawn down to be advanced to the Borrower.</p>
    <p>9.21 Once the Loan Auction has completed successfully the Borrower will be provided with an Offer Letter and will be asked to accept the Offer Letter within a stated period of time. If the Offer Letter is not accepted within the required time frame by the Borrower it will Lapse. If the Offer Letter lapses the blocked Lender Member’s monies within the Lender Member’s Account allocated for their Bid will be unblocked and become available to be utilised by the Lender Member. BLNL has the discretion to extend the period for acceptance of the offer letter.</p>
    <p>9.22 The Blend Platform’s solicitors will seek to complete the Loan as soon as reasonably practicable after the Loan Auction has completed and the Offer Letter has been accepted by the Borrower. BLNL as the Lender Member’s Agent will enter into the Loan Agreement as agent on behalf of the Lender Members participating in the Loan.</p>
    <p>9.23 Once your money has been allocated to a specific Loan, you are bound by the terms of the Loan Agreement with the relevant Borrower.</p>
    <p>9.24 All of your Loan Participations are visible to you within the dashboard of your Lender Member’s Account section in the Blend Platform.</p>
    <p>9.25 You agree that all Loan Participations that you enter into through Blend Platform can be repaid early by Borrowers without notice and we have the right to repay your capital and accrued interest into your Lender Member’s Account at our absolute discretion without prior notification.</p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">10. Successful Bids</h2>
    <p><strong>Loan documents</strong></p>
    <p>10.1 For the avoidance of doubt, any Loan will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement, which shall comprise:</p>
    <p>10.1.1 the Loan Documents; and</p>
    <p>10.1.2 the Security Documents (as applicable).</p>
    <p>10.2 If you purchase a Loan Participation from another Lender (pursuant to clause 17 below) (‘the Transferee’), you will take an assignment or novation of the Transferees rights and interest in the Loan Participation you have purchased.</p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">11. Fees</h2>
    <p>11.1 The Borrower will be charged the following fees on the drawdown of the Loan:</p>
    <p>11.1.1 the Sponsor’s arrangement fee payable by the Borrower to the Sponsor as agreed by the Borrower and the Sponsor; and</p>
    <p>11.1.2 the BLNL listing fee payable by the Borrower to the BLNL as agreed by the Borrower and BLNL;</p>
    <p>such sum shall be deducted by BLNL from the Loan at drawdown.</p>
    <p>11.2 The Borrower shall throughout the term of the Loan be charged the ongoing Services Fees as set out in the Loan Agreement.</p>
    <p>11.3 If a Borrower’s direct debit fails a £75 penalty fee will be payable to BLNL by the Borrower.</p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">12. Capital and Interest Payments</h2>
    <p>12.1 Repayments of Loan capital and interest shall be made from the Borrower’s bank account by direct debit to the Borrower’s e-wallet with MangoPay. A direct debit mandate will be completed by the Borrower prior to receipt of the Loan.</p>
    <p>12.2 On receipt into the Borrower’s e-wallet with MangoPay of a Borrower’s payment of capital and or interest on a Loan such monies shall be allocated to the corresponding Lender Member’s Account in accordance with their Loan Participation within 2 Business Days, save as provided for in clause 8.7 above in the event of a partial payment received from the Borrower.</p>
    <p>12.3 You acknowledge that no interest will be paid to you in the event that the relevant Borrower defaults in making interest payments under the relevant Loan.</p>
    <p>12.4 All repayments capital and payments of interest made to Lender Members shall be made without the deduction of any taxes. It is the Lender Member’s responsibility to account for any income tax and other personal taxes that may be payable by the Lender Member with all relevant authorities.</p>
    <p>12.5 Interest on any Loan shall start to accrue on the close of the Loan Auction.</p>
    <p>12.6 Interest accrued from the date the Loan Auction closes to the start date of the Loan shall be paid on the first interest repayment date specified in the Loan Particulars.</p>
    <p>12.7 In the event that a Loan does not complete the Lender Member shall not be entitled to any interest on the monies they have Bid for such Loan.</p>
    <p>12.8 We shall not be liable for any delay nor any resulting consequences in crediting your Lender Member Account with any amount received by way of a capital repayment or interest payment provided we or our agents have taken all reasonable steps as soon as reasonably practicable to comply with the regulations and operating procedures of any recognised clearing or settlement system used for this purpose.</p>
    <p>12.9 Any withdrawal of funds requested by a Lender Member from their Lender Member Account shall be made to Lender Member’s Designated Bank Account. To change details of the Lender Member’s Designated Bank Account the Lender Member will need to contact the BLNL Platform.</p>
    <p>12.10 BLNL shall at its discretion be entitled on the draw down of a Loan to retain a proportion of such Loan in an escrow account (the “Retention”) and utilise the Retention to meet some of the Borrower’s interest repayments on such Loan.</p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">13. Engagement of the BLNL as the Lender Member’s Facility Agent</h2>
    <p>13.1 Each successful Loan Auction is likely to involve numerous Lender Members as Loan Participants and it is therefore impractical for each Lender Member who is a Loan Participant to sign the Loan Agreement and Security Documentation. It is also impractical for each Lender Member who is a Loan Participant to take decisions if an Event of Default occurs in respect of a Loan.</p>
    <p>13.2 To deal with these issues it is therefore necessary for Lender Members who are Loan Participants to appoint (i) a facility agent to act on their behalf in relation to their Loan Participation and the Loan Agreement (the “Agent”), and (ii) a security trustee to act as their security trustee in relation to the Security provided by a Borrower for their Loan.</p>
    <p>13.3 Lender Members hereby irrevocably agree to appoint BLNL as their Agent in respect of any Loan in which they are a Loan Participant to perform the following duties for so long as their Loan Participation remains outstanding:</p>
    <p>13.3.1 to make the Loan available to the Borrower on behalf of the Lender Members;</p>
    <p>13.3.2 to communicate the Lender Members’ Loan Participations to the relevant Borrowers;</p>
    <p>12.3.3 to negotiate on behalf of the Lender Members who are Loan Participants the terms of and sign the Loan Agreement subject to any specific terms of the relevant Loan as set out in the Loan Auction Particulars and any applicable interest rate determined by the bidding process (if applicable);</p>
    <p>13.3.4 to pay to the Borrower the Loan net of all such deductions;</p>
    <p>13.3.5 to arrange for the deductions and retentions set out within the Loan Particulars to be deducted from the Loan and paid to the persons indicated therein (or retained by BLNL as the Blend Platform operator, as the case may be);</p>
    <p>13.3.6 to undertake the day to day management and administration of the Loan throughout the term of the Loan including ongoing monitoring;</p>
    <p>13.3.7to offer a facility for Loan Participants through the Blend Platform to re-sell or re-assign their interests in existing loans through the Blend Platform;</p>
    <p>13.3.8 to negotiate and agree any amendments to a Loan Agreement;</p>
    <p>13.3.9 to manage the recovery processes where any Borrower has failed to make payments to Loan Participants under any Loan Agreement or where an Event of Default has occurred;</p>
    <p>13.3.10 to exercise the rights, powers, authorities and discretions given to the Security Trustee under or in connection with the Loan Agreement (together with any other incidental rights, powers, authorities and discretions).</p>
    <p>13.4 Notwithstanding any other clause in these terms and conditions or within the Loan Documents, Lender Members hereby agree and authorise the BLNL (acting as Agent on behalf of the Lender Members) in BLNL’s absolute discretion to take the following steps as part of any Loan recovery or management process:</p>
    <p>13.4.1 to take any enforcement steps or commence any legal proceedings against a Borrower if an Event of Default has occurred;</p>
    <p>13.4.2 to enforce or release any Security;</p>
    <p>13.4.3 to agree to the restructuring of a Borrower or of a Loan or of the Security provided for a Loan including (but not limited to) agreeing to vary the interest rate payable for a Loan, the repayment date of a Loan or a reduction in the capital repayment amount for a Loan.</p>
    <p>13.4.4 to sub-contract or delegate any recovery process to a third party;</p>
    <p>13.4.5 to take or instruct the taking of such actions BLNL considers in good faith as being appropriate in its sole discretion to protect the interests of the Lender Members. For the avoidance of doubt BLNL may in such circumstances agree to amend or vary any of the terms of Loan Agreement on behalf of the Lender Members without consulting with or obtaining the consent of the Lender Members and Lender Members shall be bound by these revised terms. Such discretion shall include (but not be limited to):</p>
    <p>(i) varying the applicable interest rate (upwards or downwards) on a Loan;</p>
    <p>(ii) extending or reduce the term of a Loan;</p>
    <p>(iii) reducing the capital amount to be repaid in respect of a Loan;</p>
    <p>(iv) to restructure the Loan repayment schedule;</p>
    <p>(v) allowing a Borrower repayment holiday;</p>
    <p>(vi) allowing a period of interest only repayments, whether or not this has the effect of increasing the term of the Loan.</p>

    <p>13.5 The Lender Members further irrevocably agree that any Security provided by a Borrower in respect of a Loan in which a Lender Member is a Loan Participant shall be held by BLNL or the Security Trustee and BLNL or the Security Trustee shall be entitled to enforce the Security on the Lender Member’s behalf where necessary.</p>

    <p>13.7. Where the BLNL incurs additional costs in recovering a repayment on behalf of the Lender Members, if these costs cannot be recovered from the Borrower BLNL shall be entitled to recover these fees from the Lender Members.</p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">14. Engagement and Powers of the Security Trustee</h2>
    <p>14.1 Each Lender Member in relation to any Loan in which such Lender Member has a Loan Participation hereby irrevocably agrees to appoint Security Trustee as their security trustee to hold the Security Documents relating to such Loan and any assets thereby charged as trustee on behalf of the Lender Members participating in such Loan.</p>
    <p>14.2 If it becomes necessary to enforce the Security Documents, Lender Members agree that the Security Trustee may act on the Lender Members behalf as their agent to enforce the Security Documents with the aim of recovering money equal to the Borrower’s liability to the Lender Members under each Loan.</p>
    <p>14.3 Each Lender Member hereby grants to the Security Trustee the following powers, discretion and authority</p>
    <p>14.3.1 to exclusive right to take such action including without limitation, the exercise of all rights, discretions or powers and enforcement rights (and the granting of consents or releases) given to the Security Trustee under or in connection with the Security Documents; and</p>
    <p>14.3.2 to act on the instructions of BLNL in its capacity as Agent of the Lender Members.</p>
    <p>14.4 The powers, trusts, authorities and discretions conferred upon the Security Trustee shall be in addition to any which may from time to time be vested in the Security Trustee by the general law or otherwise.</p>
    <p>14.5 The Security Trustee will hold the assets charged under any Security Documents upon trust for itself and for all Lender Members who are Loan Participants in the Loan advanced to that Borrower. From time to time the Security Trustee may perform (before or after any enforcement under the terms of the Security Documents) all obligations, rights and benefits given to the Security Trustee by any all assets security agreement, assignments, legal mortgage and/or chattels mortgage and by any future security that the Security Trustee may take in respect of the debt due under the Loan or under any document entered into pursuant to such all assets security agreement, assignments, legal mortgage, chattels mortgage and/or future security. The Security Trustee shall have certain powers and discretions conferred upon trustees and may also rely on:</p>
    <p>14.5.1 any representation, notice or document believed by it to be genuine correct and appropriately authorised and;</p>
    <p>14.5.2 any statement made by any director, authorised signatory or employee of any person regarding any matters which may reasonably be assumed to be within his knowledge or within his power to verify.</p>
    <p>14.6 Where monies recovered are not sufficient to repay all of the Lender Members, the net proceeds recovered (after deduction of charges) will be shared between the Lender Members on a pro-rata basis.</p>
    <p>14.7 There may be circumstances where the Security Trustee holds the benefit of the Security Documents for more than one syndicate group of Lender Members who have advanced monies to a Borrower. By way of example</p>
    <p>14.7.1 a Loan Auction may specify that a Loan is comprised of two parts, a senior ranking Loan and a junior ranking Loan with Lender Members being given an opportunity to Bid for both of senior ranking Loan and a junior ranking Loan. In such circumstances the Security Trustee will hold one set of Security Documents for the senior ranking Loan and one set of Security Documents for the junior ranking Loan. The Security Documents held by the Security Trustee for the senior ranking Loan shall rank in priority to the Security Documents held by the Security Trustee for the junior ranking Loan. In the event of an enforcement of the Security Documents the proceeds realised from the senior Loan Security Documents will be paid to the Lender Member who have Loan Participations in the senior ranking Loan and once they have been repaid in full any remaining balance will then be paid to Lender Members who have Loan Participations in the junior ranking Loan</p>
    <p>14.7.2 a Loan Auction may specify that there is an intention to make a series of Loans to a Borrower and the Security taken for each such Loan will rank pari passu. In such circumstances the Security Documents held from time to time by the Security Trustee in relation to such Loans shall rank pari passu.</p>
    <p>14.7.3 a Loan may be advanced to a Borrower with Security Document being held by the Security Trustee for such Loan and at a later date a further Loan may be advanced to the Borrower with such further Loan ranking behind the original Loan advanced to the Borrower. In such circumstances in the event of an enforcement of the Security Documents the proceeds realised from the first Loan’s Security Documents will be paid to the Lender Member who have Loan Participations in the first Loan and once they have been repaid in full any remaining balance will then be paid to Lender Members who have Loan Participations in the second Loan.</p>
    <p>14.8 The Security Trustee will as appropriate enter into a declaration of ranking to regulate the priority of the Security Document it holds for two or more Loans to the same Borrower.</p>
    <p>14.9 Each Lender Member agrees that the Security Trustee shall be entitled to be paid, out of the proceeds of any recovery under the Security Documents, an amount equal to the reasonable costs (including legal and other professional costs) incurred by the Security Trustee in taking action to pursue repayment of the Loan following an Event of Default.</p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">15. Our Liability to a Lender Member</h2>

    <p>We will transfer your personal data to the third parties noted below, or as obligated by law.<strong></strong><br></p>
    <p><strong>Material service providers.&nbsp;</strong>We will transfer your personal data to the following third parties who provide us with a material service:</p>
    <p>MangoPay, Credit Safe, Experian, North Row (formerly Contego) and other credit reference agencies and other third parties for the purposes of anti-money laundering checks and fraud prevention.</p>
    <p><strong>Generic service providers.&nbsp;</strong>We may transfer your personal data to third parties who control or process personal data on our behalf to enable the efficient technical and logistical provision of our services. These service providers supply us with cloud data storage, data security services, customer relationship management software, and support ticketing services. We may substitute a technical or logistical service provider from time to time. Such parties are generally not permitted to use your personal data for any other purposes than for what your personal data was collected, and we require them to act consistently with applicable laws and this Notice as well as to use appropriate security measures to protect your personal data.</p>
    <p><strong>Event driven transfers.&nbsp;</strong>We may transfer your personal data to third parties in certain events where is it necessary to protect your, or our, legitimate interests. This includes the cessation, sale or transfer of our business; civil or criminal legal, or regulatory, proceedings; or insurance claims.</p>
    <p><strong>International transfers.&nbsp;</strong>Our products and services may be provided using resources and servers located in various countries around the world. Therefore, your personal data may be transferred outside the country where you use our services, including to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). We will only transfer data in such circumstances if the level of data protection in that jurisdiction is deemed adequate, or if there are appropriate safeguards in place to protect your privacy.</p>
    <p><strong>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
    <p>We will only keep your personal data for so long as it is reasonable for us to do so, depending upon the nature of the data and our processing, and the grounds upon which we collected it. In general, we will delete redundant account information within 14 days of our relationship ending. However, we are obliged to keep certain records of our relationship to comply with the FCA’s rules, in which case we will instead restrict access through our archiving processes. Subject to any actual or potential legal claim, the maximum time that we envisage retaining any of your information is five (5) years, after which time it will be destroyed.</p>
    <p>Information we use for marketing purposes will be kept by us until you notify us that you no longer wish to receive this information. If you do notify us that you no longer wish to receive marketing information we will keep an encrypted version of your contact information to ensure we respect your wishes.</p>
    <p><strong>PROTECTING YOUR PASSWORD</strong></p>
    <p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
    <p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS?</strong></p>
    <p>You have the right to request information and access to the personal data we hold about you.</p>
    <p>You also have the right to request that we correct or delete any incomplete, incorrect, unnecessary or outdated personal data we hold on you. However, we cannot delete such personal data that is necessary for compliance, our binding legal obligations or if the personal data must be retained according to applicable laws or is required for the exercise or defence of a legal claim.</p>
    <p>In case you consider your personal data collected by us to be inaccurate, but you do not wish your personal data to be deleted; if we have used your personal data unlawfully or you have objected to the processing and the existence of legitimate grounds for processing is still under consideration, you may request restriction of processing of your personal data.</p>
    <p>You may also at any time object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing purposes, sending promotional materials, profiling, or for the performance of market research. Further, where your personal data is processed based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent for such processing at any time.</p>
    <p>In case you wish to make use of your rights mentioned above, you may, as appropriate and in accordance with applicable laws, exercise such rights by contacting us through the contact points referred in the marketing materials or below in this Notice. In some cases, especially if you wish us to delete or cease the processing of your personal data, this may also mean that we may not be able to continue to provide the services to you.</p>
    <p>Please note that we may need to identify you and to ask for additional information in order to be able to fulfil your above requests. Please also note that applicable law may contain restrictions and other provisions that relate to your above rights.</p>
    <p>You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:contact@blendnetwork.com">contact@blendnetwork.com</a>&nbsp;or telephone our customer service line on 02034093300.</p>
